# Lucky Try - A Simple Swift Game

## Overview
Lucky Try is a fun and straightforward game developed in Swift. Users input their details, and the game randomly selects a winner from the pool. It's a neat way of engaging friends in a friendly wager or decision-making.

## Purpose
The primary objective behind the development of "Lucky Try" was to learn and gain practical experience with SwiftUI. SwiftUI is a powerful user interface tool that allows developers to design and manage iOS apps in a more simplified and efficient manner. Additionally, the project was built using the MVVM architecture.
  
By working on this project, I aimed to understand SwiftUI's functionalities, benefits, and limitations.
